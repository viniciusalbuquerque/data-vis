## Predicting Projects statuses proposed on Kickstarter platform
#### by Vin√≠cius Albuquerque

This project was developed in Python using the library
scikit-learn.

The official website of this lib is:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/

There you can find all the documentation needed to use
the libs on your projects.

The dataset used to develop this project was acquired
on the Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/).

The obtain the used public dataset, you can access the
url: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects.

I'm also including the dataset in the .zip of the submission.

Other libs that were used are libs for visualization, such as
matplotlib and seaborn.

Another two very important libs that were very helpful to the
project are: pandas and numpy. They faccilitate the work a lot
by letting us manipulate arrays, series and dataframes in a way
that we can simplify our work a lot.
